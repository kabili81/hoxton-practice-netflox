// This is the exercise for the refresher thing

// Today we're building a very simplified version of Netflix from scratch. Netflox :kappa:

// The implementation is up to you. The primary focus is core javascript . Don't worry about styling too much, use minimal CSS to make the app usable.

// The purpose of this exercise:
// - to find out which concepts you get stuck on
// - unblock you where you get stuck
// - to see how well you know your tools
// - check how confident you are with trying things yourselves

// Nico and myself will be checking in on every one of you and to get them brains rollin'.

// Repo: hoxton-practice-netflox

// Instructions:
// - jump into a üçê
// - share your screen
// - start coding

// Deliverables:
// - The app should have 4 movies.
// - Each movie should contain:
//   - an id
//   - a title
//   - a thumbnail URL
//   - a short description (you can lorem ipsum it)
//   - comments (just strings are fine)
// - As a user, when I launch the app, I should see a grid of movie thumbnails on a page.
// - Clicking on a movie should take the user to a page with:
//    - the rest of the information about the movie
//    - a back button that takes them back to the list.

//    ‚ö†‚ö†‚ö†- BONUS  a form to leave a comment for that movie. entering a comment in a form and hitting enter should:
//      - add a comment to the rest
//      - clear the form
